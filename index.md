## Welcome to my blog

Since the opposite would be pointless and boring, I will try to reserve this space for meaningful thoughts about interesting things, though I make no promises.

### Things I like

 - Computer programming
 - Computer games
 - Computer chair

### Other things I like (in no particular order)

 - The wife & kids
 - Funky beats _(beats, funky beats, rock the funky beats?)_
 - Slow, meandering hikes through lush, unkempt native wilderness
 - Petrichor

### Things I don't like

 - Lack of attention to detail
 - Pedantry
 - No more wine
 - Probably other things too

### Why blog?

Sometimes I find myself obsessing over a topic or subject more than usual. I can spend hours, days, or weeks turning it over in my head, researching, and figuring out how it fits with everything I already knew (or thought I knew).

The constant learning and discovery can be quite entertaining and sometimes even confronting. But the topics are usually pretty niche, and few people are interested. Afterwards is always a bit of an anticlimax scuttling back into my introvert shell with no one to celebrate with.

So I guess I find the act of writing about whatever random crap I'm thinking about to be one way to close the loop, or maybe even leave a foot in the door to discovering more about something, like Hansel and Gretel leaving breadcrumbs to find their way back later.
